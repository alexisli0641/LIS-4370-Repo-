R Markdown is a tool that is imbedded in R that allows for the intersection of code, text, and outputs into a single document for easier reading. 

R Markdown is very helpful for analysis and provide narrative text to help explain what a document is presenting. 

# Math Examples
Inline math example: $\alpha + \beta = \gamma$.



```{r}

library(ggplot2)

```


```{r}

mtcars$model <- rownames(mtcars)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = reorder(model, hp), y = hp)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Horsepower by Car Model",
       x = "Car Model",
       y = "Horsepower")


```


Working with R Markdown is very different from writing plain reports. Knitting the document also provides a clean, styled output without manual formatting, making it ideal for data analysis workflows.
